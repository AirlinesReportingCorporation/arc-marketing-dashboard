# Refunds 

For uploading to EpiServer there are two tasks: uploading the refunds spreadsheet and uploading a document for the editor to put on the refunds spreadsheet. 

For both they are put into the refunds folder. For the refunds file, just upload the spreadsheet to the refunds folder, the file should be named refunds.xlsx.  Any document they want uploaded goes to the refunds folder too and just give them the link when uploaded.

## GitHub Repo 

If you need to update the code or the copy at the bottom you need to update the code in the github: 

The repo is here: [https://github.com/AirlinesReportingCorporation/airline-refunds](https://github.com/AirlinesReportingCorporation/airline-refunds) 

The files should be in the src/ folder and once the changes are ready do a npm run build to get the completed files in the dist/ folder.  Those files should be uploaded to the refunds folder in EpiServer.
